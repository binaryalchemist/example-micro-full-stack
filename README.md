# Example Of Microfrontends With Microservices

## Overview
This repository contains an example of some microservices written in Rust with microfrontends written in React.  This was a working a example of patterns that come up for me professionally frequently written in two frameworks that I just happened to enjoy working with.  It's not intended to be a full working framework and is just a reference for how something like this might look.  As this evolves, it evolves this will likely just contain more of my thoughts and experiments.
